First need to buy the domain(Eg: www.example.com)
Then create a private key using the OpenSSL in local
creating/request for CSR to the same OpenSSL by providing the path to the private key
OpenSSL will ask the domain, provide it, then the CSR file will get generated
upload this CSR file in the godaddy, then godaddy will provide you the signed certificate like certificate body and certificate chain via email/download
Lastly import the certificate body, certificate chain and private key in the ACM


That CSR contains:

	Your public key
	Your domain name (CN/SANs)
	Metadata
	A signature generated using your private key
